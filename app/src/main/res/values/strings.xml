        <b>Scroggle</b>
        \n\
        This is a very interesting word game mainly based on old Boggle word game where you form words
        from the given letter in the grids of one 3X3 large grid and 9 3X3 smaller grids.
        \n\
        <b>Duration and Phases:</b>
        Total of 3 minutes with two phases.
        Each phase runs for 1.5 minutes.
        At the end of each phase, the game will automatically take you to the next phase.
        \n\
        <b>Operations:</b>
        One short click on one letter if you want to pick that letter, and long click on one letter if you
        are finishing the word form in that grid.
        \n\
        <b>Rules:</b>
        1. In the first phase, play boggle on each of the small grids,i.e., form a word for each smaller grid
        consisting of 3 to 9 letters.
        \n\
        2. You will have 9 words with those letters for your second phase. In the second phase,
        by picking one letter from each quadrant, you can form words again.
        \n\
        3. You can revisit the grids but not select two letters in the same quadrant one after another.
        \n\
        <b>Scoring rules:</b>
        Different points for different letters:
        \n\
        1. 1 point each for E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
        \n\
        2. 2 points each for D, G
        \n\
        3. 3 points each for B, C, M, P
        \n\
        4. 4 points each for F, H, V, W, Y
        \n\
        5. 5 points for K
        \n\
        6. 8 points each for J, X
        \n\
        7. 10 points each for Q, Z
        \n\
        The length of the words formed will also affect the points:
        \n\
        word length: 3 - 5, points: the length of the word
        \n\
        word length: 6, points: 10
        \n\
        word length: 7, points: 15
        \n\
        word length: 8, points: 20
        \n\
        word length: 9, points: 25
        \n\
