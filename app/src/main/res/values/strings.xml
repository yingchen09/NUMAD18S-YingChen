        <b>Scroggle</b>
        \n\
        An interesting word game mainly based on age old Boggle word game where you form words
        from the given letter in the grids.
        \n\
        \n\
        <b>Scroggle Board :</b>
        The board consists of one 3X3 Large Grid with 9 smaller grids with each smaller grid itself being 3X3 grid.
        \n\
        \n\
        <b>Duration and Phases :</b>
        Game duration is of 3 minutes and consists of two phases with each phase running for 1.5 minutes.
        At the end of 1.5 minutes, the game automatically takes you to the next phase if you click on OK on the pop up.
        \n\
        \n\
        <b>Rules</b>
        \n\
        <b>i.</b> In the first phase, play boggle on each of the small grids,i.e., form words consisting of 3 to 9 letters.
        \n\
        <b>ii.</b> So you will have 9 different words(if you have found words in all 9 grids) for your second phase.
        \n\
        <b>iii.</b>In the second phase, all the words formed in phase one are displayed. Now form words by picking one letter
        from each quadrant. You can revisit the grids but not back-to-back which means that suppose the letter T is one grid,
        letters A and P are in same grid. the word TAP cannot be formed since A and P are in the same grid.
        \n\
        <b>iv.</b>Points for each phase is displayed
        \n\
        \n\
        <b>Scoring :</b>
        Each correct word formed fetches you certain points. Below is the split:
        \n\
        \n\
        <b>i. </b> One point each for E, A, I, O, N, R, T, L, S, U
        \n\
        <b>ii. </b> Two points each for D, G
        \n\
        <b>iii. </b> Three points each for B, C, M, P
        \n\
        <b>iv. </b> Four points each for F, H, V, W, Y
        \n\
        <b>v. </b> Five points for K
        \n\
        <b>vi. </b> Eight points each for J, X
        \n\
        <b>vii. </b> Ten points each for Q, Z
        \n\
        <b>viii. </b> Individual words will also fetch points depending on its length
        \n\
